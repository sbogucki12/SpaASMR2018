# Spa ASMR 2018


## Summary

This is my third attempt to build a directory of ASMR videos.  I had built two others as Angular apps.  This one will be built via .NET MVC 5 on top of a SQL Server database, performing most of the logic on the server side.  

## Technologies ( so far )

+ .NET MVC 5
+ SQL Server 
+ Entity Framework
+ Visual Studio
+ git (gitHub)

## Timeline

+ Day One (March 7, 2018) AM: 
- Created Artist, Video, Video Genre data models.
- Connected to SQL Server Express. 
- Used migration to create SQL Server database.

I for real need a job :) 

ISO junior to mid dev position in the Los Angeles area.  My strength is C# fundamentals and I'm getting better daily with MVC.  I've deployed apps to Azure, Heroku, and AWS with Angular and AngularJS front-ends, but I intend to relearn vanilla JavaScript from the ground-up, just as I have C#.  Please check out my LinkedIn:
